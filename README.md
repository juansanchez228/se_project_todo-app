# Simple Todo App

A small web app to help you keep track of tasks and chores. You can add new items, mark them as completed, and remove them when they’re done. It’s designed to be simple, clear, and easy to use.

## Functionality

Each task gets a unique ID

Mark tasks as completed with a checkbox

Delete tasks from the list

A counter shows how many tasks are completed out of the total

Form validation ensures inputs are correct before adding a task

After submission, the form resets and the submit button is disabled until valid input is entered again

## Technology

HTML: builds the structure of the app (form, list, popup)

CSS: styles the layout and makes it user‑friendly

JavaScript: adds interactivity (task creation, validation, counters, popup handling)

Uses a FormValidator class for input validation and the uuid library to generate unique IDs

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
